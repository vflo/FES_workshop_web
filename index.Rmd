<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most biosphere’s ecosystems provide goods and services that are key to human well-being. Referred as ecosystem Services (ES) or more broadly Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), their provisions vary depending on their geographical and biophysical context, the anthropogenic management and the history of previous disturbances. Ecosystem services have been frequently quantified as absolute physical magnitudes or as monetary values. These absolute values, however, may not always be the best approximation for comparing a certain ES provided by different ecosystems or under different historical or socio-ecological contexts. For instance, woodlands located in very arid areas may show lower annual carbon sequestration rates than forests in more humid areas, although the former may be closer to their maximum sequestration physical boundaries than the latter. Therefore, higher absolute values do not necessarily mean that a specific ecosystem is more valuable in context-dependent terms. For this reason, it is key to consider historical (e.g., ES past and future provision evolution), ecological, geographical (e.g., ES provision by spatially related ecosystems) and social (e.g., society ES demand) contexts for an adequate comparison of ES in different areas.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This workshop aims to identify when context dependency is relevant to measure ES and the different types of contexts that may exist for comparing ES (i.e., geographic -e.g., spatial scale-, temporal, social -e.g., society impact and demand-, etc.). In order to simplify the discussions about the topic, we will use forest ecosystem services (FES) as a case of study. In addition, to better address this framework, the workshop will be structured following a series of general conceptual questions, mainly focused in why should we or how can we compare FES.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>QUESTIONS</h2>

<b>Why should we compare FES?</b> To highlight i) the main drivers explaining FES supply, and ii) the main reasons for (or against) the comparisons on the delivery of ES. For example, we will identify relevant cases where comparing ES should be (or not) recommended, including, among others: research aims, management purposes, conservation priorities, etc. Here we will include additional aspects such as the need to assess multiple values which can be dependent on the spatial and temporal scales, but also the importance of developing detailed assessments of the health of these ecosystems for human well being .

<b>How can/should we compare FES?</b> The objective is to establish the foundations for a framework of new metrics based on ES indicators that will enable us to compare a set of different ES among different social, spatial and temporal contexts. Specifically, we will discuss about:

* <b>Dealing with FES indicators and FES components</b> To identify and enumerate which FES and which of their components (ecological/potential supply, demand, etc.) are sensitive to vary across contexts. Also, we will review the most frequently used indicators and proxies to quantify ES and those which can be applied to forests. 

* <b>Dealing with the socio-ecological context.</b> The benefits we obtain from the forests are multiple and include a wide variety of FES. However, different social groups perceive, for example,  different types of FES. For this reason it seems key to assess multiple values of forests with respect to different societies characteristics and demands. Thus, here we will discuss how we can characterise the different socio-ecological systems, or why this key for assessing accurately FES.

* <b>Dealing with the spatial and the temporal contexts.</b> ES delivery is not constant and their benefits may show spatial and temporal changes. Thus, to determine different levels of variation relevant for the comparison of ES is key. Here, we will determine the different mesurables periods and spatial scales and the type of data sources that can be useful to perform comparisons of ES taking into account the spatial and temporal scales. Particularly, we will assess spatial ES variation from macro-scale (ie. biogeographical context and over-country level) to local scale (landscape heterogeneity and city administrative demarcations). Also, we will identify the role of the temporal context (temporal trends and resolution) in ES comparison. 

* <b>Dealing with relationships among FES and with standardization issues.</b>ES relationships (i.e. synergies or trade-offs, bundles, …), or comparisons for single ES vs. multidimensionality/trade-offs are also key when dealing with ES comparisons. Finally, we will describe potential methodologies to transform or normalise ES values to make them comparable. Thus, we will review currently existing methods to compare ES and will develop new approaches to standardise ES depending on ES types and discussed contexts.

I am Ecology Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB, Spain) and researcher at the CREAF (Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications, Spain). My research has focused on the study of the structure, functioning and dynamics of plant communities, and in particular Mediterranean ecosystems, in relation to different sources of anthropogenic disturbance, such as fire, droughts, pests, and invasions by exotic species. I address the mechanisms providing resilience in the face of the regime of climate change-driven disturbances, considering the functional and demographic attributes and the climatic niche of the species and its contribution to the assembly of these communities.

PhD in Biological Sciences (UAB, 1992). My main research interests focus on the interaction among land use and forest management changes, particularly forest expansion and regrowth after rural abandonment, and the impact of climate change. My aim is to investigate the influence of land use legacies in forest dynamics and whether recent forests are more or less resilient to climate change than long-existing ones. Under this uncertain ecological scenario, I am interested in the factors driving tree growth and their sensitivity to climate, the variability of seed production, the balance among positive and negative plant-animal interactions (seed predation or dispersal) and, finally, the determinants of tree recruitment.

I am a Lecturer in Ecology at the University of Reading, UK. Broadly, my research tries to identify how conservation, management and restoration actions can be spatially targeted to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services, principally in forests. I am interested in developing analytical approaches for synthesising heterogeneous datasets for quantifying how management effects on biodiversity and forest health (susceptibility to pests and diseases), vary across different social-ecological contexts. I am also interested in the effects of large herbivores on forest landscapes and the importance of human-nature interactions for mental health.

I am interested in understanding how people can better manage our landscapes sustainability to deliver the things we need now (food, low carbon energy, clean water) while also maintaining the biodiversity that ultimately sustains us all. I have a particular focus on understanding trade-offs, as we live in an age where there are no perfect choices - everything has an impact - but some things have less negative impacts than others (i.e. renewable energy as compared to fossil fuels).   My work is highly applied, and targets questions such as where do we focus tree planting in the UK or what are the relative effects of public and private greenspace on mental health. I mostly working with existing 'big data' , and have a strong focus on methods development, and questions of spatial scale, and frequently link computer and statistical models in new ways.

My research seeks to understand the drivers and consequences of social-ecological interactions and its various implications on sustainability, mainly on ecosystem services flows and on equity in the access to those services. In particular, I investigate the effect of land use intensification on the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services, on the synergies and trade-offs between services, and on the social relationships between actors. I analyse these relationships at multiple spatial scales and model social-ecological scenarios to inform land management and restoration policies.
