<h2>
OVERVIEW
</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Most biosphere’s ecosystems provide goods and services that are key to
human well-being. Referred as ecosystem Services (ES) or more broadly
Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), their provisions vary depending
on their geographical and biophysical context, the anthropogenic
management and the history of previous disturbances. Ecosystem services
have been frequently quantified as absolute physical magnitudes or as
monetary values. These absolute values, however, may not always be the
best approximation for comparing a certain ES provided by different
ecosystems or under different historical or socio-ecological contexts.
For instance, woodlands located in very arid areas may show lower annual
carbon sequestration rates than forests in more humid areas, although
the former may be closer to their maximum sequestration physical
boundaries than the latter. Therefore, higher absolute values do not
necessarily mean that a specific ecosystem is more valuable in
context-dependent terms. For this reason, it is key to consider
historical (e.g., ES past and future provision evolution), ecological,
geographical (e.g., ES provision by spatially related ecosystems) and
social (e.g., society ES demand) contexts for an adequate comparison of
ES in different areas.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
This workshop aims to identify when context dependency is relevant to
measure ES and the different types of contexts that may exist for
comparing ES (i.e., geographic -e.g., spatial scale-, temporal, social
-e.g., society impact and demand-, etc.). In order to simplify the
discussions about the topic, we will use forest ecosystem services (FES)
as a case of study. In addition, to better address this framework, the
workshop will be structured following a series of general conceptual
questions, mainly focused in why should we or how can we compare FES.
</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h2>
QUESTIONS
</h2>
<p><b>Why should we compare FES?</b> To highlight i) the main drivers
explaining FES supply, and ii) the main reasons for (or against) the
comparisons on the delivery of ES. For example, we will identify
relevant cases where comparing ES should be (or not) recommended,
including, among others: research aims, management purposes,
conservation priorities, etc. Here we will include additional aspects
such as the need to assess multiple values which can be dependent on the
spatial and temporal scales, but also the importance of developing
detailed assessments of the health of these ecosystems for human well
being .</p>
<p><b>How can/should we compare FES?</b> The objective is to establish
the foundations for a framework of new metrics based on ES indicators
that will enable us to compare a set of different ES among different
social, spatial and temporal contexts. Specifically, we will discuss
about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Dealing with FES indicators and FES components</b> To identify
and enumerate which FES and which of their components
(ecological/potential supply, demand, etc.) are sensitive to vary across
contexts. Also, we will review the most frequently used indicators and
proxies to quantify ES and those which can be applied to
forests.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dealing with the socio-ecological context.</b> The benefits we
obtain from the forests are multiple and include a wide variety of FES.
However, different social groups perceive, for example, different types
of FES. For this reason it seems key to assess multiple values of
forests with respect to different societies characteristics and demands.
Thus, here we will discuss how we can characterise the different
socio-ecological systems, or why this key for assessing accurately
FES.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dealing with the spatial and the temporal contexts.</b> ES
delivery is not constant and their benefits may show spatial and
temporal changes. Thus, to determine different levels of variation
relevant for the comparison of ES is key. Here, we will determine the
different mesurables periods and spatial scales and the type of data
sources that can be useful to perform comparisons of ES taking into
account the spatial and temporal scales. Particularly, we will assess
spatial ES variation from macro-scale (ie. biogeographical context and
over-country level) to local scale (landscape heterogeneity and city
administrative demarcations). Also, we will identify the role of the
temporal context (temporal trends and resolution) in ES
comparison.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dealing with relationships among FES and with standardization
issues.</b>ES relationships (i.e. synergies or trade-offs, bundles, …),
or comparisons for single ES vs. multidimensionality/trade-offs are also
key when dealing with ES comparisons. Finally, we will describe
potential methodologies to transform or normalise ES values to make them
comparable. Thus, we will review currently existing methods to compare
ES and will develop new approaches to standardise ES depending on ES
types and discussed contexts.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>I am is a sustainability scientist interested in human-nature
relationships and processes of sustainable transformation. I use a
governance perspective to research these phenomena on multiple levels of
social-ecological systems – from local to supranational. With my
research, I aim to better understand how actions of individuals fit into
the broader network of societal activities and how they relate to and
affect each other. Currently, I am the Deputy Science Director of the
Canadian NSERC Strategic Network ResNet - a Canada wide research project
looking at human-nature interactions in Canadian working landscapes.</p>

</p>
<p>I am a Lecturer in Ecology at the University of Reading, UK. Broadly,
my research tries to identify how conservation, management and
restoration actions can be spatially targeted to enhance biodiversity
and ecosystem services, principally in forests. I am interested in
developing analytical approaches for synthesising heterogeneous datasets
for quantifying how management effects on biodiversity and forest health
(susceptibility to pests and diseases), vary across different
social-ecological contexts. I am also interested in the effects of large
herbivores on forest landscapes and the importance of human-nature
interactions for mental health.</p>

</p>
<p>I am interested in understanding how people can better manage our
landscapes sustainability to deliver the things we need now (food, low
carbon energy, clean water) while also maintaining the biodiversity that
ultimately sustains us all. I have a particular focus on understanding
trade-offs, as we live in an age where there are no perfect choices -
everything has an impact - but some things have less negative impacts
than others (i.e. renewable energy as compared to fossil fuels). My work
is highly applied, and targets questions such as where do we focus tree
planting in the UK or what are the relative effects of public and
private greenspace on mental health. I mostly working with existing ‘big
data’ , and have a strong focus on methods development, and questions of
spatial scale, and frequently link computer and statistical models in
new ways.</p>

</p>
<p>Jean Paul Metzger is a Full Professor of Ecology at the University of
São Paulo. He obtained his MSc and PhD in Landscape Ecology at the
University of Toulouse, France. Since 1995, he has been working with
landscape planning and biodiversity conservation in highly fragmented
landscapes, essentially in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. His
main research focuses are related to landscape connectivity, ecological
thresholds and time-lag responses to landscape changes, and conservation
planning. More recently, he is exploring the relationships between
landscape structure, ecosystems services, and human well-being, besides
investigating the efficiency of environmental policies to manage
multifunctional landscapes. He also uses extensive modeling and scenario
approaches to link landscape-level processes with restoration processes.
He was the founder of the Brazilian Chapter of the International
Association for Landscape Ecology (IALE-BR) and vice-president of
IALE.</p>

</p>
<p>My research seeks to understand the drivers and consequences of
social-ecological interactions and its various implications on
sustainability, mainly on ecosystem services flows and on equity in the
access to those services. In particular, I investigate the effect of
land use intensification on the relationships between biodiversity and
ecosystem services, on the synergies and trade-offs between services,
and on the social relationships between actors. I analyse these
relationships at multiple spatial scales and model social-ecological
scenarios to inform land management and restoration policies.</p>

</p>
<p>As a mathematical biologist (Wageningen University), I am interested
in contributing to a more sustainable future. Since 2003 I have done
scientific research in applied research centers in the Netherlands,
Ireland and France. My focus area is human nature interactions, so
ecosystem services, nature conservation and sustainable agriculture have
been red threads in my research. Values of nature and ecosystem services
determine how we shape our policies and management. I have been very
fortunate to work with many highly qualified researchers around the
world, among others in the GEO BON net werk. Currently I am the director
of an independent research institute on sustainable agriculture food and
health where we work on developing knowledge towards more sustainable
foodsystems and healthy societies, together with practitioners, NGOs,
industry and policymakers.</p>

</p>
<p>I have three main research interests. One of my main interests is to
increase our understanding and ability to predict the distribution or
dynamics of (meta)populations, species, communities and ecosystem
services. In addition, I investigate how these biodiversity measures and
services can respond to future land use or climate change scenarios.
Finally, I investigate the usefulness of citizen science data to answer
basic and applied questions. Most of my studies concern the use and
conservation of forest resources.</p>

</p>
<p>I am Ecology Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona
(UAB, Spain) and researcher at the CREAF (Centre for Ecological Research
and Forestry Applications, Spain). My research has focused on the study
of the structure, functioning and dynamics of plant communities, and in
particular Mediterranean ecosystems, in relation to different sources of
anthropogenic disturbance, such as fire, droughts, pests, and invasions
by exotic species. I address the mechanisms providing resilience in the

<p>PhD in Biological Sciences (UAB, 1992). My main research interests
focus on the interaction among land use and forest management changes,
particularly forest expansion and regrowth after rural abandonment, and
the impact of climate change. My aim is to investigate the influence of
land use legacies in forest dynamics and whether recent forests are more
or less resilient to climate change than long-existing ones. Under this
uncertain ecological scenario, I am interested in the factors driving
tree growth and their sensitivity to climate, the variability of seed
production, the balance among positive and negative plant-animal
interactions (seed predation or dispersal) and, finally, the
determinants of tree recruitment.</p>

<p>I am Professor of Ecology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona
and researcher at CREAF, where I was director from 2005 to 2019. My
research is based on the study of forest dynamics and the effect of
disturbances, especially fire, on animal and plant communities and
ecosystem services. I am currently the coordinator of the European LIFE
MIDMACC project on the adaptation of Mediterranean mountains to climate
change, and the national GREEN-RISK project on the limitations of
integrated modelling at landscape and regional scales and the
development of a procedure for future assessments of changes in
biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p>

</p>
<p>I work at the frontier between plant biology and environmental
sciences, at the interface with global change. My major contributions to
science are in the study of the carbon and water cycles of forests,
across Boreal, temperate, tropical and Mediterranean biomes of Europe,
the Americas, Australia and Africa. I have authored more than 200
peer-reviewed papers. I am very involved in debates concerning how more
severe droughts, as a consequence of climate change, can accelerate tree
mortality. One area of major contribution has been in identifying the
processes by which plant physiological properties affect the likelihood
of survival following extreme drought events. I am also very interested
in how canopies of forest trees can act as filters of atmospheric
nitrogen deposition via their leaf microbiome.</p>

<p>I am an Environmental Scientist (University of Barcelona, 2011) and
PhD in Terrestrial Ecology (University Autonomous of Barcelona, 2020).
My main research interests are related to forest disturbance dynamics
and ecosystem services. I’m currently an Alexander von Humboldt
postdoctoral fellow at the Technical University of Munich, assessing the
risk of losing forest ecosystem services due to disturbances.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at CIBIO/InBIO (Portugal)
analyzing the stakeholders’ perceptions of wildfires and the economic
impacts of fire-management scenarios in ecosystem services, and a
predoctoral fellow at CREAF analyzing the spatial patterns of forest
ecosystem services, their conservation implications and their risk to
climate change-hazards.</p>

<p>I am PhD in Terrestrial Ecology (UAB 2012). My research focuses on
understanding the factors that regulate forest demographics, functional
biogeography, diversity, and functioning to global environmental change,
and the integration of this information for management and conservation
purposes. I address key questions at the intersection between ecology
and biogeography, including theoretical and empirical development. I
have primary focused on drought-stressed forests, either by
distributional constraints (rear edge populations, and
Mediterranean-type vegetation) or climate change-type drought, by
combining large-scale field experiments and analysis of large
datasets.</p>

<br> Biological station near Barcelona. Located in the Serra de <a
href="https://www.parcnaturalcollserola.cat/en/">Collserola</a> Natural
Park, one of the metropolitan area of Barcelona’s largest and best
preserved forest areas, Can Balasc has laboratories and greenhouses, a
guest house with rooms for visiting researchers, and 100 ha of forests
and experimental sites for research purposes. It is ideal for evaluating
the effects of global change on Mediterranean metropolitan ecosystems,
which provide essential ecosystem services and are especially affected
by drivers of global change (land use changes, wildfires and invasive
species). Several field experiments that have been running for more than
15 years and are part of the Spanish and European Long Term Ecological
Research Networks (LTER-Spain and LTER-Europe) have been taking place at
Can Balasc since 2012.</p>
