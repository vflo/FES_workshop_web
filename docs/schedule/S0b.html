	<p>Relevant scientific literature on the services and benefits of forests (and forest landscapes).</p>
	<br>
	<p>In this second preliminary session, we will discuss published studies, identified during the previous weeks, that are relevant to the characterisation and quantification of different ecosystem services provided by forests. These papers may serve as a basis for articulating some of the discussions that will take place during the following days of the workshop. Selected papers should include different methodological approaches, study areas, etc.</p>
