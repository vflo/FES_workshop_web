		<br>
	  <p>General summary of the workshop.</p>
		<br>
	  <p>What are our main findings and challenges? Organised into three groups, we will recall the different aspects discussed during the last three days, including the initial approach, the conclusions of each thematic session and the questions from each talk. The idea of this last discussion is to distill a coherent overall structure and the key aspects that will serve as a starting point for a scientific manuscript.</p>
		<br>
	  <p>Time for joint discussion.</p>
		<br>
    <p>Plan for output. 60 min. Finally, we will shape the structure for the aforementioned manuscript, defining specific tasks for each participant, and setting reasonable deadlines for writing it.</p>
