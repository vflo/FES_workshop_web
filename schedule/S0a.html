	<p>In this first session, participants will be provided with a general introduction to the ecosystem services approach (or other concepts that can be considered equivalent), both from a general point of view and in relation to forest ecosystems). Its historical evolution, main applications, strengths and weaknesses will be reviewed. The main typologies of services will also be identified and those most closely linked to forests and forest stands will be highlighted.</p>
