	<p>Identifying case studies and sources of information for quantifying forest services.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In this last preliminary session, we will try to select potential study areas where, based on available information (cartography, national forest inventories, satellite images, etc.), it would be possible to develop forest ecosystem services analysis. This will be done on the basis of the previously discussed aspects and using some of the identified scientific works as examples. Emphasis will be placed eg: on the need to compare different areas, on the services analysed (they should be analogous and quantified in a similar way in order to be compared in meta-analysis type studies), etc.</p>
